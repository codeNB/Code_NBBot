## Contribution Guide for Code_NB's Discord chatbot

If you are interested in working on this project I invite you to start a conversation on our group's [discord channel](https://discord.gg/2d7pdka). There are also some conversations about the project from early on in the issues (though this was a while back in the project).

Generally speaking I would like to hear about your plans before recieving pull requests and/or there should be helpful comit/pull request comments. Just so I have a bit of context before excepting features into the bot.

We are hoping to create something that is helpful to the group. :+1:
